## Introduction

GhostCore represents the evolution of game security integration, completely rewritten from the ground up with a focus on security, stability, and user experience. Version 1.5 marks a significant milestone, transforming VACPASS v1.4 into a more sophisticated and secure platform.

### The Journey to v1.5

The transition from VACPASS to GhostCore wasn't just a rebrand, it represents a fundamental shift in approach.. Key improvements include:

- DLL Locker system for secure cheat management
- Sophisticated CLI with realtime monitoring and configuration
- Dynamic agent protection with runtime obfuscation
- Enhanced server resource management and stability
- Advanced authentication and HWID binding
- Configurable stealth mode operation

## What's New in v1.5

### 1. The DLL Locker System
- Secure encrypted storage container for DLLs
- File attribute protection (Hidden + System)
- Automatic encryption/decryption during operations
- Secure cleanup with file melting
- Memory safe DLL handling
- Automatic decrypted file removal after process termination

### 2. Enhanced CLI Interface
- Advanced console UI with realtime updates
- Advanced login and authentication system
- Interactive configuration management
- Realtime system monitoring
- Color coded status indicators
- User friendly menu navigation

### 3. Advanced Security Features
- Hardware based authentication with HWID binding
- Dynamic runtime protection keys
- Enhanced encryption for all operations
- Improved antidebug measures
- Secure agent name obfuscation
- Optional stealth mode operation

### 4. Improved Architecture
- Flexible directory management
- Enhanced server resource handling
- Automatic version compatibility checking
- Improved socket stability
- Advanced error handling
- Streamlined configuration system

## Architecture Overview

GhostCore v1.5 uses a modular architecture with several key components:

## Core Features

### Agent Protection

```cpp
// snippet of dynamic runtime protection
std::string REDACTED::REDACTED() {
const int KEY_LENGTH = 0; // Redacted Size
std::random_device rd;
std::mt19937 gen(rd());
std::uniform_int_distribution<> dis(0, 255);
std::stringstream ss;
for (int i = 0; i < KEY_LENGTH; ++i) {
ss << std::hex << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << dis(gen);
}
return ss.str();
}
```

### GC DLL Locker
```cpp
// snippet of DLL Locker
bool REDACTED::REDACTED(const std::wstring& gcOBDPath) {
if (!isLocked) return false;
std::wstring fileName = std::filesystem::path(gcOBDPath).filename().wstring();
std::wstring gcOBDEPath = lockerPath + L"\\" + fileName;
try {
std::filesystem::copy_file(gcOBDPath, gcOBDEPath,
std::filesystem::copy_options::overwrite_existing);
SetFileAttributesW(gcOBDEPath.c_str(),
FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN | FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM);
return true;
}
catch (...) {
return false;
}
}
```

## Security Measures

1. **Process Protection**
   - Runtime memory encryption
   - Dynamic protection keys
   - Anti debugging measures
   - Memory integrity checks
   - Process obfuscation
   - Stealth mode

2. **Network Security**
   - Encrypted communication
   - Enhanced socket stability
   - Rate limiting
   - Version compatibility checking
   - Session validation
   - HWID + GC Auth + Disc Auth checks

3. **File Security**
   - Secure DLL storage
   - File melting
   - Encrypted configuration
   - Secure cleanup routines
   - Automatic file removal

## Technical Deep Dive

### The Locker System
GhostCore's Locker system provides security for cheat management:

1. **Initialization**
   - Hidden system directory creation
   - Dynamic encryption key generation
   - Secure attribute configuration
   - Memory safe initialization

2. **Operation**
   - Automatic locking/unlocking
   - Secure file operations
   - Memory safe handling
   - Realtime encryption/decryption

3. **Cleanup**
   - Secure file melting
   - Memory wiping
   - State reset
   - Process termination cleanup

### Authentication System
The new authentication system provides multiple layers of security:
- Hardware ID binding
- Ratelimited login attempts
- Secure key storage
- Session management
- Autologin capability
- Discord Auth

## Future Roadmap
