Welcome to my security research blog! I am a self taught security researcher focused on Reverse Engineering, Pentesting, and Exploit Development.

- I focus on Windows mainly, but I do have some Linux experince and knowledge.
- I do not have a degree in Computer Science or Security.
- I do not work for any security firm.
- I do like to have fun though :D

## What to Expect

Here, I'll be sharing my own research and detailed technical writeups about:

- Reverse Engineering & Game Hacking
- Pentesting & Exploit Development
- Security Research & Vulnerability Disclosure
- Security Tool Development

Stay tuned for in depth technical content!
