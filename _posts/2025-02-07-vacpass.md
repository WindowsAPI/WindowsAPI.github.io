## Introduction

**VACPASS** is an advanced Valve AntiCheat (VAC) bypass seamlessly integrated with a Discord bot. This project enables users to set up the necessary environment, authenticate in my server, and inject internal cheats into VAC protected games all within Discord.

### **Why I Created VACPASS**

I've been in the game hacking scene for a while, but CS2's new anticheat updates introduced fresh challenges. While browsing **UnknownCheats** after years, I noticed most people were focused on external cheats rather than internals. Seeing the lack of innovation and overall assistance, I decided to develop a **more effective, user friendly bypass** that will remain undetected for longer.

### **Evolution of the Project**

Initially, I was working on another project (which I'll reveal soon), experimenting with **multiple injection techniques** so I thought why not test around see what I can do. I'll be going over a full detailed writeup of the full process soon, but in short it took me about a week of overall testing before I landed on a nice method.  During this process, I found the bypass injection flow to be tedious and inefficient I'll explain why. At first, my bypass was written in **Python (using cpython & wintypes)**, but I later converted it into **C++** for better performance and security.

One night, after talking to a friend on Discord, I recalled how malware developers use **Discord as a C2 (Command & Control)** system. That’s when it hit me, why not design a **cheat injection system controlled via Discord?**

After extensive testing and refining the architecture, I developed **VACPASS v1.3**, a fully operational and reliable bypass. This marks the third working build, and it’s now ready for beta testing.

If you're interested in testing VACPASS, you can apply or inquire about access here: [Discord](https://discord.gg/2HezDVufug)

## What is VACPASS?

As mentioned earlier VACPASS is a **Discord Bot based VAC bypass** that allows users to inject internals into **VAC protected games** while staying undetected. It offers:

- A **streamlined, automated injection process**
- **Encrypted DLL support** for added security
- **Secure TCP communication** between bot and agent
- A **hilarious and smooth** way to manage cheats via Discord

Unlike outdated Process Hacker methods, VACPASS is designed for **efficiency, stealth, and ease of use** to make internal cheating great again.

## How It Works

### **Setup**
1. **Prepare Environment:**
   - Download the required files
   - Set up the specified directory
   - Add antivirus exclusions for proper operation
   - Open **port 31337** for incoming communications

2. **Authentication:**
   - Users must authenticate to gain access
   - Prevents unauthorized use

3. **Running the Agent:**
   - Encrypts DLLs & injects them into the game process

4. **Using Discord Commands:**
   - `!run <key>` → Injects an **encrypted DLL**
   - `!update <key>` → Encrypts a **non encrypted DLL**

## Small Code Overview

Let's dive into *SOME* snippets of key components that make VACPASS work:

### **Setup Process**
```powershell
function Setup-VACPASSDirectory {
Write-ColorOutput Green "Setting up VACPASS directory..."
if (-not (Test-Path $VACPASS_DIR)) {
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $VACPASS_DIR | Out-Null
Write-ColorOutput Yellow "Created directory: $VACPASS_DIR"
}
}
function Add-AntiVirusExclusions {
    Write-ColorOutput Green "Adding Windows Defender exclusions..."
    Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath $VACPASS_DIR
    $processes = @(
        "$VACPASS_DIR\vacpass.exe",
        "$VACPASS_DIR\kernel32.dll"
    )
    foreach ($process in $processes) {
        Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess (Split-Path $process -Leaf)
    }
    Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "\\.\pipe\VAC_AGENT"
    Write-ColorOutput Yellow "Added Windows Defender exclusions"
}
```

### **Firewall Configuration**
```powershell
function Write-ColorOutput($ForegroundColor) {
    $fc = $host.UI.RawUI.ForegroundColor
    $host.UI.RawUI.ForegroundColor = $ForegroundColor
    if ($args) {
        Write-Output $args
    }
    $host.UI.RawUI.ForegroundColor = $fc
}

# Check admin rights
$currentPrincipal = New-Object Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal([Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent())
if (-not $currentPrincipal.IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)) {
    Write-ColorOutput Red "This script requires administrator privileges!"
    exit 1
}

Write-ColorOutput Green "Configuring TCP Firewall Rules..."
$ruleName = "VACPASS Agent TCP"
Remove-NetFirewallRule -Name $ruleName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
try {
    New-NetFirewallRule -Name $ruleName `
        -DisplayName $ruleName `
        -Description "Allow VACPASS Agent TCP Communications" `
        -Direction Inbound `
        -Protocol TCP `
        -LocalPort $TCP_PORT `
        -Action Allow | Out-Null
    
    Write-ColorOutput Yellow "Successfully added TCP firewall rule for port $TCP_PORT"
} catch {
    Write-ColorOutput Red "Error creating firewall rule: $_"
    exit 1
}
```

### VAC Bypass Core

Here are core components that help assist the actual bypass which I wont be showing today:

```cpp
DWORD REDACTED(const wchar_t processName) {
DWORD processId = 0;
HANDLE snapshot = CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0);
if (snapshot != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
PROCESSENTRY32W processEntry = { sizeof(processEntry) };
if (Process32FirstW(snapshot, &processEntry)) {
do {
if (wcsicmp(processEntry.szExeFile, processName) == 0) {
processId = processEntry.th32ProcessID;
break;
}
} while (Process32NextW(snapshot, &processEntry));
}
CloseHandle(snapshot);
}
return processId;
}

REDACTED::REDACTED(DWORD pid) : processPID(pid) {
processHandle = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, pid);
}
```

*I put 0s to REDACT the key size.*

```cpp
bool REDACTED::REDACTED(const std::wstring& dllPath, const std::string& key, std::wstring& outPath) {
    try {
        Log("Encryption key detected - preparing to decrypt DLL...");
        std::ifstream file(dllPath, std::ios::binary);
        if (!file) {
            Log("Failed to open encrypted DLL");
            return false;
        }
        std::vector<uint8_t> encrypted_data(
            (std::istreambuf_iterator<char>(file)),
            std::istreambuf_iterator<char>()
        );
        file.close();
        std::vector<uint8_t> key_bytes(key.begin(), key.end());
        std::vector<uint8_t> full_key;
        while (full_key.size() < 0) {
            full_key.insert(full_key.end(), key_bytes.begin(), key_bytes.end());
        }
        full_key.resize(0);
        std::vector<uint8_t> decrypted_data;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < encrypted_data.size(); i++) {
            decrypted_data.push_back(encrypted_data[i] ^ full_key[i % full_key.size()]);
        }
        std::wstring fileName = dllPath.substr(dllPath.find_last_of(L"/\\") + 1);
        std::wstring directory = dllPath.substr(0, dllPath.find_last_of(L"/\\") + 1);
        outPath = directory + fileName + L".dec";
        std::ofstream outFile(outPath, std::ios::binary);
        if (!outFile) {
            Log("Failed to create decrypted DLL");
            return false;
        }
        outFile.write(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(decrypted_data.data()), 
                     decrypted_data.size());
        outFile.close();
        Log("DLL successfully decrypted");
        return true;
    }
    catch (const std::exception& e) {
        Log("Error during DLL decryption: " + std::string(e.what()));
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Technical Details

### **Communication Flow**
1. Discord bot receives commands
2. Commands are forwarded to the VACPASS agent via **TCP**
3. The agent processes the request and performs the injection
4. Results are sent back to Discord for **realtime feedback**

## Security Measures
- **Encrypted DLLs** before transmission
- **Secure TCP communication** for command execution
- **Authentication** required for every operation
- **Admin privileges** recommended for proper functionality

## Future Improvements
1. **Advanced encryption** for DLL protection
2. **Additional injection methods** (currently testing 2 more)
3. **Support for more games** beyond CS2 & TF2
4. **Improved error handling** & failure recovery
5. **Expanded command set** for greater flexibility

## Technical Considerations
- **Admin privileges not required** for agent
- **Port 31337 must be open** for communication
- **Antivirus exclusions necessary**
- **Proper system setup mandatory** before use
